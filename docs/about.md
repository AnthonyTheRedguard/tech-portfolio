I am currently attending GHC20 (Grace Hopper Celebration 2020). I began this portfolio in a workshop and it is the greatest idea ever!
You can start your "About" page with an elevator pitch, one or two
sentences about you! The rest of this page page can
include a little bit about yourself. Some things you
might include:

1. Your current position
2. Organizations you're involved with
3. Your personal and professional values
4. Hobbies or fun facts

Write it in first (I) or third (Your Name Here) person.

> Don't know what to write? Get a good friend to help! Set some time aside to soundboard.
